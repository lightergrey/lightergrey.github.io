The shame of being a web designer without a website has finally gotten to me. So, now I have a website.

The plan is to start with an imperfect something and itterate on it in public as I have the time. For so long I've had a more elaborate plan that just doesnâ€™t seem to ever get started. This at least is started.

There will be more exciting posts coming soon. Maybe.
