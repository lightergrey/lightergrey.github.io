The past year has been full of big changes for me: work, home and everything in between. The newest change is that I'm joining [Tinybop](http://tinybop.com) as their XX.

I shared office space with Raul as he was working to start Tinybop and from the beginning you could see that he was going to succeed. Of course there's no such thing as a sure thing and his reality was probably far from smooth sailing. His vision for what Tinybop could be was clear and impressive. Almost immediately I thought of how cool it'd be to work on it with him. 

Now I get to do just that.
