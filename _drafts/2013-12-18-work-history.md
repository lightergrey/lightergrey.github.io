There's lots to be said about the journey that lead me here. I moved to New York in 2002 from Starkville, Mississippi where I'd lived from the third grade through the end of college. The first couple of months I lived on Jessi's couch and scrambled to find a job. Eventually I ended up at George/Gerard Design (now [hgDesign](http://hgdnyc.com)) which was a great thing to have happen to me. Hershell was more than a boss, he was a mentor.

During my time there Creighton, Jessi and I were doing freelance work on the side. Creighton had some clients that he needed help with and the three of us worked together really well. For a while we would spend our nights and weekends working on these projects and our days on our jobs. It quickly became clear that we should make a business out of it or stop and get lives. We made a business out of it.

Starting [Workshop](http://workshoplovesyou.com) was the smartest and hardest career choice I ever made. The next 7 years were a whirlwind. We moved from our livingroom floor into Milton Glaser's office in Murray Hill.
