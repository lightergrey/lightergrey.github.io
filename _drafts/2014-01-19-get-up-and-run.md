Hereâ€™s what worked for me when I wanted to get in shape.
{: .lead-in}

Getting an inside-kid outside.

I've never really been in shape at any point in my entire life. There were moments where I tried. My short lived elementary soccer stint, playing spring trainging football at my state champion high school football team, the more idiotic try at High School Soccer, langushing gym memberships, a very sad 4 month shot at running. The football thing was by far the stupidest, I was 130ish pounds 5 feet 8 inches, the other guys were monsters who took pride in laying out the little guys when we got brave enough to try and tackle them.

Nothing ever stuck, mostly because I didn't like doing whatever it was. Who knows why it wasn't fun. Maybe I just wasn't the slightest bit good at any of it. We all want to be at least a little bit good at something. Feeling like an awkward dork isn't going to make you come back for more even if you know it's good for you.

Fitness is important since most of us spend our days sitting for 8+ hours

The thing that did it was resetting my expectations and finding something that I liked even a little bit.

Walking around New York was always my favorite part of the city. Just seeing it all go by and feeling like an anonymous part of the city that belonged there just as much as the other freaks walking by. I'd setup scenarios that let me walk further. My choices to get to work were a 12 minute bike ride, a 20 minute public transportation trip or 45 minutes of walking. I started picking the walk and challenging myself to find new routes that showed me more of the city that I'd adopted. I decided that I'd take the 5 flights of stairs coming and going from the office. (The death trap elevator at Studiomates made this descision easier.) Little things like that added up, but they weren't the critical mass that I needed.

The real turning point happend when I joined Captain Quinn's Bootcamp. It was a completely judgement free zone, really. There was a sense that these people were waiting on Sarah and I to show up, and we showed up. Occationally in class we'd have sprints and as I started loosing weight and getting stronger, the running sucked less. Around July of 2010 I started adding in short slow runs to supplement Bootcamp. After the first 2 mile run I thought I might die. Somehow I conviced myself to do it again, then that I should do it for a month, then I started liking it and looking forward to it more than the other workout. My time at bootcamp was done. It was great, but damn it I was going to be a runner.

I ran for 6 months at a comfortable pace increasing the distace and pace incrementally. The most appealing part was challenging myself to cover that extra mile, and do it quicker each time. Maybe I should do a race? I signed up for the Jingle Bell Jog in Prospect Park. The startline was a 10 minute walk from my appartement and the 4 mile distance felt doable. Aside from the ridiculously loud jingle bells attached to 1000 running shoes, the event was an eyeopening success. I could run, fast. And as a bonus, I liked it.

A month later I ran a 10k, weeks after that a half-marathon, and on and on. Along the way there were a million questions on how to get better, how to avoid injury, how to dress for bad weather. I aske everyone I knew who was even a little bit sporty. In fact I couldn't stop talking about running. Sarah got tired of it, my Studiomates put up a good show, but even they got tired. I needed an outlet for my new-found love of running. Prospect Park Track Club was the answer. I joined up and signed up for speedwork sessions. They helped me get faster, but mostly it was the comradery that drew me to it. I found a running buddy to keep me company for the distance runs which were now getting quite long.

Eventually I got up the nerve to sign up for a marathon. I half way thought that I'd bail on it. Putting something on the books as a goal had worked so far though, so I set a goal. The 18 weeks of training included over 900 miles. Getting out and seeing parts of the city I was unfamiliar with was such a motivation. A dount at a South Brooklyn bakery at the end of a run. Dumplings in Flushing as a reward after a race. A 12 mile run to Coney Island. A 16 mile trip out to see the recently battered Rockaways. 16 mile to Inwood Park to see the northern most point of Manhattan. Covering all that area compacted and connected the city in a way that I never expected. I've never been great at judging distances, but now Sunset Park wasn't this distant area where Brooklyn had it's own Chinatown. It was a neighborhood 4 short miles away. I could get there on my own power in 35 minutes.

Distance running is an individual sport that you can do with other people. I don't race the other competitors in a race, I'm racing myself from the last time I did that distance. There's a built-in challenge to get a better time each race. To run a longer race. The simplicity and endless game play built in is absolutely a motivator.

I lost 30 pounds. It wasn't easy to do, but the concept was simple and super straight forward. Eat fewer calories than I was burning in all the running. It was a trackable data nerdy activity. I was mastering the system that my body was using.

My Path.

In 2013, my first full year as a runner, I covered about 1,455 miles total. (That's racing, training and running for fun.)

Growing up as an inside kid, there really wasn't much that could motivate me to be active. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a complete bum. I played soccer in elementary school and again for a bit in high school. It would have been nice to continue with it, only I sucked.

In 2012, Sarah and I decided to try Captain Quinn's Bootcamp at the urging of our friend Nicky. We ran short sprints in class and as I burned off the extra fat I was carrying around, it became my favorite part of class.
