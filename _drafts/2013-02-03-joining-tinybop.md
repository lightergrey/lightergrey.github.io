The past year has been full of big changes for me: becoming a father, work and everything in between.

I shared office space with Raul as he was working to start [Tinybop](http://tinybop.com) and from the beginning you could see that he was on to something. Of course there's no such thing as a sure thing and his reality was probably far from smooth sailing. His vision for what Tinybop could be was clear and impressive. Almost immediately I thought of how cool it'd be to work on it with him.

Now I get to do just that as their Front-End Developer.
